# Quest Origin Fix - Verification Checklist

## Problem Statement
Quests were not properly showing their origin. When parents added quests, they didn't display as coming from NPCs. Object-based daily tasks also showed incorrect origins.

## Solution Implemented
Added an `origin` field to distinguish between:
1. **Object quests** - Daily tasks from interactive objects
2. **NPC quests** - Parent-added quests via NPCs

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Object Quest Creation
**Steps:**
1. Start the game
2. Walk to any interactive object (e.g., Dirty Dishes in kitchen)
3. Click on the object
4. Accept the quest
5. Check the quest in the player's quest list (sidebar)

**Expected Result:**
- Quest should show "From Dirty Dishes" (or relevant object name)
- Quest should have room emoji, not NPC emoji
- Quest should be marked with origin='object' internally

### 2. Test Parent Quest Creation
**Steps:**
1. Open Parent Mode (password: hero123)
2. Create a new quest
3. Select an NPC (e.g., Chef Wizard)
4. Fill in quest details and create
5. Check the quest in the active quests list

**Expected Result:**
- Quest should show "From Chef Wizard" (or selected NPC)
- Quest should have NPC emoji and color
- Quest should be marked with origin='npc' internally

### 3. Test Welcome Modal Display
**Steps:**
1. Have both an object quest and a parent quest active
2. Open the welcome modal (should show on game start)
3. Check the "Current Quest" and "Most Pressing Quest" sections

**Expected Result:**
- Each quest should clearly show its origin
- Object quests: "from [Object Name]"
- NPC quests: "from [NPC Name]"

### 4. Test Parent Mode Quest List
**Steps:**
1. Open Parent Mode
2. Scroll to the "Active Quests List" section
3. Observe both incomplete and completed quests

**Expected Result:**
- Object quests show with room emoji/color and object name
- NPC quests show with NPC emoji/color and NPC name
- Clear visual distinction between the two types

### 5. Test Backward Compatibility
**Steps:**
1. If you have old quests from before this update
2. Check that they display correctly

**Expected Result:**
- Old quests without origin field should still work
- They should intelligently determine origin based on npcId
- No console errors

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- `src/game.js` (main game file)

### Key Functions Added/Updated
1. **getQuestOriginName(quest)** - NEW
   - Returns appropriate display name based on quest origin
   - Handles both object and NPC quests
   - Backward compatible

2. **createQuest(...)** - UPDATED
   - Added `origin` parameter (defaults to 'npc')
   - Properly tags quests based on creation method

3. **updatePlayerQuestList()** - UPDATED
   - Uses getQuestOriginName() for display
   - Shows correct emoji and colors

4. **updateActiveQuestsList()** - UPDATED
   - Parent mode quest management
   - Distinguishes object vs NPC quests visually

5. **Accept Quest Button Handler** - UPDATED
   - Object quests explicitly marked with origin='object'
   - NPC quests use default origin='npc'

### Data Structure Changes
```javascript
// Quest object now includes:
{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    npcId: string,        // 'wizard', 'goblin', 'pet', 'owl' OR object type
    room: string,
    level: number,
    difficulty: string,
    xpReward: number,
    gemReward: number,
    irlReward: string,
    acceptedByPlayer: boolean,
    completed: boolean,
    origin: string        // 'object' or 'npc' ← NEW FIELD
}
```

## Success Criteria
✅ Object quests show object names as origin
✅ Parent quests show NPC names as origin
✅ Visual distinction in all quest displays
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Backward compatible with old quests
✅ JavaScript syntax validation passes
✅ No console errors

## Notes
- The fix is minimal and surgical - only necessary changes made
- Default origin='npc' ensures all parent-created quests work correctly
- Only object quest creation explicitly passes origin='object'
- Backward compatibility ensures smooth transition
