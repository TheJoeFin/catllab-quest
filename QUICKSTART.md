## 🌐 Deploy to Azure (5 minutes)

### Easiest Method: Azure Portal

1. **Go to**: https://portal.azure.com
2. **Create Static Web App**:
   - Name: `habithero`
   - Region: Choose closest
   - Plan: **Free**
   - Deployment: Upload your files or connect GitHub
3. **Upload these files/folders**:
   - `index.html`
   - `parent-dashboard.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `parent-dashboard.css`
   - `src/` folder
   - `sounds/` folder
   - `staticwebapp.config.json`
4. **Done!** Your app is live at:
   ```
   https://habithero-xxxxx.azurestaticapps.net
   ```

### Alternative: GitHub Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Converted to static web app"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Azure Portal**:
   - Create Static Web App
   - Select "GitHub" as source
   - Authorize GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build presets: Custom
   - App location: `/`
   - Output location: (leave empty)

3. **Automatic Deploy**:
   - GitHub Actions runs automatically
   - App deploys in 2-3 minutes
   - Future pushes auto-deploy!

## 📱 Mobile/Tablet

Your app works great on mobile!

**To add to home screen**:
- **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Add to Home Screen

Acts like a native app! 🎉

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored in **browser localStorage**:
- Player stats
- Quests
- Rewards
- Pet name
- Progress

**Important**:
- Each browser/device has its own data
- Clearing browser data = losing progress
- Use same device for parent dashboard and game

## 🎮 For Kids

1. Open the game URL
2. Walk around with arrow keys or click to move
3. Click on characters and objects
4. Accept quests
5. Do chores in real life
6. Come back and mark quests complete
7. Earn gems and unlock rewards!

## 👨‍👩‍👧 For Parents

1. Click "Parent Mode" button
2. Password: `hero123` (you can change this in code)
3. Create quests using templates or custom
4. Create rewards with gem costs
5. Monitor progress in Parent Dashboard

**Open Parent Dashboard**:
- Same folder as game
- Open `parent-dashboard.html`
- Must be on same device/browser as game (uses same localStorage)

## 📊 What Changed?

### Before:
- Needed Node.js server running
- Required SQLite database
- Had Socket.IO for real-time sync
- Complex deployment

### Now:
- Just static files
- All data in browser
- No server needed
- Deploy anywhere!

### What You Lost:
- Real-time sync between devices
  - **Fix**: Use same device OR refresh manually

### What You Gained:
- ⚡ Much faster (no server calls)
- 💰 Free hosting
- 🔒 More private (data stays on device)
- 🌍 Works offline
- 📱 Easier to use

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Game won't load?**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Try Chrome/Edge/Firefox
- Make sure all files are in same folder

**Data not saving?**
- Enable localStorage in browser settings
- Not in private/incognito mode
- Check browser compatibility

**Sounds not working?**
- Click something first (browsers need user interaction)
- Check volume
- Verify sound files in `/sounds` folder

**Parent Dashboard empty?**
- Must open on SAME device/browser as game
- localStorage is per-browser

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your app is now:
