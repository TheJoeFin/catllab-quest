## 🚀 Deployment (Azure Static Web Apps)

This app is now a **pure static website** with no backend dependencies!

### Prerequisites
- Azure account
- GitHub account (optional, for CI/CD)

### Quick Deploy

1. **Option A: Via Azure Portal**
   - Go to Azure Portal
   - Create new Static Web App
   - Connect your repository or upload files
   - Set build configuration:
     - App location: `/`
     - Output location: `` (empty)
   - Deploy!

2. **Option B: Via Azure CLI**
   ```bash
   # Login to Azure
   az login

   # Create resource group
   az group create --name habithero-rg --location eastus

   # Create static web app
   az staticwebapp create \
     --name habithero \
     --resource-group habithero-rg \
     --source https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/catllab \
     --location eastus \
     --branch main \
     --app-location "/" \
     --output-location ""
   ```

3. **Option C: Local Testing**
   Simply open `index.html` in a web browser - no server needed!

## 📁 File Structure

```
/
├── index.html              # Main game interface
├── parent-dashboard.html   # Parent control panel
├── style.css              # Game styles
├── parent-dashboard.css   # Dashboard styles
├── src/
│   ├── game.js           # Core game logic (localStorage-based)
│   └── sounds.js         # Sound manager
├── sounds/               # Audio files
│   ├── click.mp3
│   ├── quest-complete.mp3
│   └── ... (other sounds)
└── staticwebapp.config.json  # Azure Static Web Apps config
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Storage
All data is stored in **browser localStorage**:
- Player stats (level, XP, gems)
- Quest list
- Reward vault
- Pet name
- Daily quest progress

### Multi-Device Usage
Since data is stored locally in the browser:
- **Same device**: Works perfectly, data persists
- **Different devices**: Each device has its own data
- **To sync**: Use parent dashboard on same device as game

## 🎨 For Parents

### Creating Quests
1. Open the game
2. Click "Parent Mode" button
3. Enter password (default: `hero123`)
4. Use quest templates or create custom quests
5. Assign to NPCs in different rooms

### Creating Rewards
1. In Parent Mode, go to "Reward Vault" section
2. Add rewards with gem costs
3. Kids can unlock rewards when they earn enough gems

### Monitoring Progress
Open `parent-dashboard.html` to see:
- Current level and XP
- Total gems earned
- Active quests
- Completed quests
- Pending rewards

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Parent Password
Edit line 6 in `src/game.js`:
```javascript
const PARENT_PASSWORD = 'hero123'; // Change this
```

### Adjust XP Requirements
Edit the `getXpNeeded()` function in `src/game.js`

### Modify Quest Templates
Edit the `QUEST_TEMPLATES` object in `src/game.js`

## 📝 Migration Notes

This app was converted from a Node.js/Express/Socket.IO/SQLite architecture to pure static files. All functionality remains intact, with the only change being that real-time sync between devices was replaced with manual refresh.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Data not saving?**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Check browser not in private/incognito mode

**Sounds not playing?**
- Check browser allows autoplay
- Check sound files are in `/sounds` folder
- Check volume is up

**Can't see updates on another device?**
- Each device stores data locally
- Use same device for parent dashboard and game
- Or manually copy localStorage data between devices
