# Ultimate Reward Banner Implementation

## Overview
Added a prominent banner at the top of the game displaying the ultimate reward goal: **A Trip to Disney Land for 21,000 Gems**.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML (index.html)
- Added Ultimate Reward Banner section immediately after the opening `game-container` div
- Banner includes:
  - Two animated emoji icons (üè∞ and üé¢)
  - Title: "üéâ ULTIMATE REWARD üéâ"
  - Reward name: "Trip to Disney Land!"
  - Current gems / 21,000 Gems progress display
  - Progress bar showing visual representation of goal completion

### 2. CSS (style.css)
- Styled `.ultimate-reward-banner` with:
  - Eye-catching gradient background (red ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí green)
  - Continuous pulse animation
  - Shine effect animation
  - Prominent drop shadows and glow effects
  - Icon bounce animations
  - Text glow effects
  - Progress bar with shimmer animation

- Added responsive styles for:
  - Desktop (1024px+): Full width banner with all elements
  - Tablet (768px): Smaller icons and text
  - Mobile (480px): Vertical layout, single icon
  - Small mobile (360px): Compact sizing

### 3. JavaScript (src/game.js)
- Added `updateUltimateRewardBanner()` function that:
  - Updates current gems display with proper formatting (comma separators)
  - Calculates and updates progress bar width (0-100%)
  - Called automatically when `updatePlayerStats()` is invoked

- Banner updates automatically when:
  - Page loads (via `init()`)
  - Gems are earned from quest completion
  - Stats are refreshed from parent dashboard changes

## Features

1. **Visual Appeal**: Gradient background with continuous animations creates excitement
2. **Real-time Updates**: Progress bar and gem count update automatically
3. **Responsive Design**: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes
4. **Motivational**: Prominently displays the ultimate goal to encourage engagement
5. **Performance**: Uses CSS animations for smooth, efficient rendering

## Goal
The ultimate reward requires **21,000 gems**. Based on the gem earning rates:
- Easy quests: 1 gem
- Medium quests: 2 gems
- Hard quests: 3 gems

This creates a significant long-term goal that encourages sustained habit building and quest completion.

## Testing
To test the banner:
1. Open the application in a browser
2. The banner should appear at the top with 0/21,000 gems initially
3. Complete quests to earn gems
4. Watch the progress bar fill and gem count update in real-time
5. Test on different screen sizes to verify responsive behavior
