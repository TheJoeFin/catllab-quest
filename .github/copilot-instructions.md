## Development Server

**Important:** Do not start the npm server (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run dev`, or `node server.js`) as it is already running in another session.

When working on this project, assume the development server is active and ready to serve the application. If you need to make changes that require server restart, please notify the user instead of restarting it automatically.
