## Summary of Changes

I've transformed your HabitHero app into a more dynamic, responsive, and 3D-looking experience! Here's what was added:

### ðŸ”Š Sound Effects System

**New File: `src/sounds.js`**

#### Animations
- **Hover Effects**: 
  - Elements lift up and scale when hovered
  - Shadow expands for floating effect
  - Smooth cubic-bezier transitions
  - Wiggle/bounce animations for objects
  
- **Click Effects**:
  - Ripple effect on buttons
  - Scale-down feedback on click
  - Active state transformations

- **Special Animations**:
  - **Gem Float**: Floating gem emojis rise up when collecting gems
  - **XP Bar Shimmer**: Animated shine across XP bar
  - **Gem Pulse**: Pulsing glow on gem collection notifications
  - **Reward Shimmer**: Continuous shimmer on reward vault button

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Enhancements

**Updated: `src/game.js`**

1. **Sound Integration**:
   - Global click listener for all buttons
   - Hover sound on interactive elements (throttled to prevent spam)
   - Quest completion triggers success sound
   - Gem collection triggers happy chime
   - Level up triggers fanfare
   - Door opening triggers door sound
   - Reward unlock triggers magical sound

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Floating gem animations when collecting gems
   - Enhanced quest card hover effects
   - 3D depth on all interactive elements
   - Smooth transitions throughout

3. **Quest Cards**:
   - Gradient backgrounds
   - Lift animation on hover
   - Enhanced shadows
   - Better visual hierarchy

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

1. **Dynamic Response**:
   - All buttons respond to hover with lift effect
   - Interactive objects wiggle when hovered
   - NPCs float and bounce on hover
   - Doors have 3D perspective on hover

2. **Audio Feedback**:
   - Every interaction has appropriate sound
   - Sounds are generated programmatically (no external files needed)
   - Auto-initializes on first user interaction
   - Volume controlled (30% by default to not be overwhelming)

3. **3D Depth**:
   - Multiple shadow layers create depth
   - Inset highlights for beveled effects
   - Transform animations with translateZ
   - Perspective transforms on doors

4. **Polish**:
   - Smooth cubic-bezier easing on all animations
   - Consistent shadow language throughout
   - Ripple effects on buttons
   - Shimmer effects on special elements

## Files Modified

1. **index.html** - Added sounds.js script reference
2. **style.css** - Complete visual overhaul with 3D effects
3. **src/game.js** - Integrated sound system and enhanced interactions
4. **src/sounds.js** - NEW: Complete sound management system

## How It Works

### Sound System
The sound manager creates sounds using the Web Audio API's oscillators and gain nodes. This means no external audio files are needed - all sounds are generated in real-time! The system:
- Auto-initializes on first user interaction (required by browsers)
- Throttles hover sounds to prevent spam
- Uses musical frequencies for pleasant sounds
- Includes volume control

### Animation System
CSS animations use:
- `transform` for hardware-accelerated animations
- `box-shadow` layers for depth
- `filter: drop-shadow()` for complex shapes
- Keyframe animations for special effects

### 3D Effects
Created using:
- Multiple shadow layers (outer, inner, glow)
- Gradient backgrounds for depth
- Perspective transforms
- TranslateZ for hardware acceleration
- Scale and translate transforms on hover

## Browser Compatibility

All features work in modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge: âœ… Full support
- Firefox: âœ… Full support
- Safari: âœ… Full support
- Mobile browsers: âœ… Touch events work, sounds may require user interaction

## Performance

All animations are optimized using:
- Hardware acceleration with `translateZ(0)`
- Throttled hover sounds
- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations
- Efficient Web Audio API usage

Enjoy your enhanced HabitHero experience! ðŸŽ‰
