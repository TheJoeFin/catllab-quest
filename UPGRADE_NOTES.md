## 🎨 Visual Design Language

### Shadow System
Every element now uses a consistent 3-layer approach:
- **Layer 1**: Close dark shadow (primary depth)
- **Layer 2**: Soft ambient shadow (atmosphere)
- **Layer 3**: Inset highlight (beveled effect)

### Animation Timing
All animations use smooth cubic-bezier easing:
- Hover: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Click: Instant feedback with subtle spring
- Special effects: Varied timing for visual interest

### Color Depth
Gradient backgrounds create realistic lighting:
- Buttons: 135° gradient for directional light
- Cards: Subtle gradients for depth
- Glows: Color-matched shadows for cohesion

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Hardware acceleration with `translateZ(0)`

- ✅ Minimal JavaScript animations

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge - Full support

## 🎊 What Users Will Notice

### Immediate Impact:
1. **Everything feels alive** - Hover over anything
2. **Audio feedback** - Satisfying sounds everywhere
3. **Professional polish** - Smooth, fluid animations
